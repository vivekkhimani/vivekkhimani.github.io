NOTE: This repository is still under making! I am coding the webpage using the different frameworks that I am learning. Until this point, I have used JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4. I am planning to use Ajax and Angular JS in future. 

I have used this repository to host my personal eportfolio originally developed on the "vivekkhimani.tech" domain (domain forwarding is activated on my .tech domain). I have used Git Pages for easy, free, and hassle free hosting services.
